Dungeon doors/gates are everywhere in this world.
They can be stationary, or appear at somewhat random times all around the world.
Most dungeons get destroyed after one of the following instanced occur:
- every monster is killed
- if there is a boss, the boss is killed
- the dungeon takes to much damage
- a [[Dungeon Overflow]] happens

Dungeon colors decide the difficulty of the dungeon. The color system uses the same strength list as the classification of monsters. The colors represent:
- Blue = Baby
- Green = Human
- Pink = Giant
- Red = Dragon
- Violet/Purple = Leviathan
