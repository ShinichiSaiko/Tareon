- Turn Based Combat
- 1 turn is about 5 seconds
- Speed determines players turn order
- Every combat turn you have:
	- 1 Movement
	- 2 Actions
	- 2 Defending

- Actions are:
	- Attacking
	- Moving other than your movement action
	- Preparing actions
	- Helping others
	- Speaking
	- Prepare Defense (adds to your defending actions)
- Defending is:
	- Using your weapon to parry
	- try to dodge
- You do not need to define the type of defense when you prepare it as an action. Decide when the time comes.
- You can use 2 actions counting as 1, but with disadvantage
- Attacking can only be done in your turn, while defending can only be done as a response to an enemy attack
- Movement means you move up to 10 meters
- To attack something, means you roll a d20 and add the AT value of the weapon you are using, to hit something, or someone, in range of that weapon. It counts as a success with a total of (16) or more
- Defending is split in two options:
	- Parry works like attacking. You roll a d20 and add the PA value of the weapon you are trying to use. With a (16) or more it counts as success
	- To doge, you have to roll a d20 and have to get a result, that is lower than your current dodge value
- A combat ends once all but one Party are either dead, ran away or gave up
